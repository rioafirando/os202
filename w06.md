1. [Concurrency in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)<br>
  Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel. The running process threads always communicate with each other through shared memory or message passing. Concurrency results in sharing of resources result in problems like deadlocks and resources starvation.
2. [How does a process look like in memory?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-does-a-process-look-like-in-memory)<br>
  A program loaded into memory and executing is called a process. In simple, a process is a program in execution. When a program is created then it is just some pieces of Bytes which is stored in Hard Disk as a passive entity. Then the program starts loading in memory and become an active entity, when a program is double-clicked in windows or entering the name of the executable file on the command line.
3. [States of a Process in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/states-of-a-process-in-operating-systems/)<br>
  States of a process are as following: New, Ready, Run, Blocked or Wait, Terminated or Complete, Suspend ready, Suspend wait or suspend blocked
4. [Process Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)<br>
  The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.
5. [Context Switching](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-context-switching-in-operating-system)<br>
  Context Switching involves storing the context or state of a process so that it can be reloaded when required and execution can be resumed from the same point as earlier. This is a feature of a multitasking operating system and allows a single CPU to be shared by multiple processes.
6. [I/O Bound Process vs CPU Bound Process](http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/ossg/Process/scheduler/scheduler.html)<br>
  Processes can be categorized according to what is limiting the completion of the process : I/O Bound Process and CPU Bound Process
7. [Inter Process Communication (IPC)](https://www.guru99.com/inter-process-communication-ipc.html)<br>
  Inter process communication (IPC) is used for exchanging data between multiple threads in one or more processes or programs. The Processes may be running on single or multiple computers connected by a network. The full form of IPC is Inter-process communication.
8. [Single-threaded and Multi-threaded Processes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/single-threaded-and-multi-threaded-processes)<br>
  Single threaded processes contain the execution of instructions in a single sequence. In other words, one command is processes at a time. The opposite of single threaded processes are multithreaded processes. These processes allow the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. These are lightweight processes available within the process.
9. [Concurrency vs. Parallelism](https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/concurrency-vs-parallelism-a-brief-review-b337c8dac350)<br>
  Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
10. [Multi-Threading](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_multi_threading.htm)<br>
  A thread is a flow of execution through the process code, with its own program counter that keeps track of which instruction to execute next, system registers which hold its current working variables, and a stack which contains the execution history. Threads are implemented in following two ways: User Level Threads and Kernel Level Threads
