1. [Peterson’s Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
  The producer consumer problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer. Producer produce an item and put it into buffer. If buffer is already full then producer will have to wait for an empty block in buffer. Consumer consume an item from buffer. If buffer is already empty then consumer will have to wait for an item in buffer. Implement Peterson’s Algorithm for the two processes using shared memory such that there is mutual exclusion between them. The solution should have free from synchronization problems.
2. [What is Semaphore?](https://www.guru99.com/semaphore-in-operating-system.html)<br>
  Semaphore is simply a variable that is non-negative and shared between threads. A semaphore is a signaling mechanism, and a thread that is waiting on a semaphore can be signaled by another thread. It uses two atomic operations, 1)wait, and 2) signal for the process synchronization.
3. [Bounded Buffer Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/bounded-buffer)<br>
  Bounded buffer problem, which is also called producer consumer problem, is one of the classic problems of synchronization. In Bounded Buffer Problem there are three entities storage buffer slots, consumer and producer. The producer tries to store data in the storage slots while the consumer tries to remove the data from the buffer storage.
4. [Readers-Writers Problem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/readers-writers-problem)<br>
  The readers-writers problem relates to an object such as a file that is shared between multiple processes. Some of these processes are readers i.e. they only want to read the data from the object and some of the processes are writers i.e. they want to write into the object.
5. [Dining Philosopher Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dining-philosopher-problem-using-semaphores/)<br>
  The Dining Philosopher Problem states that K philosophers seated around a circular table with one chopstick between each pair of philosophers. There is one chopstick between each philosopher. A philosopher may eat if he can pickup the two chopsticks adjacent to him. One chopstick may be picked up by any one of its adjacent followers but not both.
6. [Resource Allocation Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/resource-allocation-graph-rag-in-operating-system/)<br>
  Resource allocation graph is explained to us what is the state of the system in terms of processes and resources. Like how many resources are available, how many are allocated and what is the request of each process. Everything can be represented in terms of the diagram. One of the advantages of having a diagram is, sometimes it is possible to see a deadlock directly by using RAG, but then you might not be able to know that by looking at the table. But the tables are better if the system contains lots of process and resource and Graph is better if the system contains less number of process and resource.
7. [Introduction of Deadlock in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/)<br>
  Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. Deadlock can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously: 1) Mutual Exclusion; 2) Hold and Wait; 3) No Preemption; 4) Cilcular Wait.
8. [Banker’s Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/)<br>
  The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
9. [Deadlock Prevention And Avoidance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-prevention/)<br>
  Deadlock has following characteristics: 1) Mutual Exclusion; 2) Hold and Wait; 3) No Preemption; 4) Cilcular Wait. We can prevent Deadlock by eliminating any of the above four conditions.
10. [Process Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)<br>
  Process Synchronization means sharing system resources by processes in a such a way that, Concurrent access to shared data is handled thereby minimizing the chance of inconsistent data. Maintaining data consistency demands mechanisms to ensure synchronized execution of cooperating processes.
