1. [Difference between Asymmetric and Symmetric Multiprocessing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-asymmetric-and-symmetric-multiprocessing/)<br>
  Multiprocessing is the use of two or more central processing units within a single computer system. Asymmetric Multiprocessing and Symmetric Multiprocessing are two types of multiprocessing. Asymmetric Multiprocessing system is a multiprocessor computer system where not all of the multiple interconnected central processing units (CPUs) are treated equally. Symmetric Multiprocessing is a type of multiprocessing where each processor is self-scheduling.
2. [Soft Affinity vs Hard Affinity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)<br>
  Processor Affinity means a processes has an affinity for the processor on which it is currently running. There are two types of processor affinity: Soft Affinity and Hard Affinity.
3. [What is NUMA (non-uniform memory access)?](http://www.techplayon.com/what-is-numa-non-uniform-memory-access/)<br>
  This era of data centric processing with huge requirement of speed between CPU and memory, gave birth to a new architecture called Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) or more correctly Cache-Coherent Numa (ccNUMA). In this architecture each processor has a local bank of memory, to which it has a much closer (lower latency) access.
4. [Difference between MultiCore and MultiProcessor System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-multicore-and-multiprocessor-system/)<br>
  A processor that has more than one core is called Multicore Processor while one with single core is called Unicore Processor or Uniprocessor. Two or more processors or CPUs present in same computer, sharing system bus, memory and I/O is called MultiProcessing System.
5. [Difference between Hard real time and Soft real time system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hard-real-time-and-soft-real-time-system/)<br>
  Real time system is defined as a system in which job has deadline, job has to finished by the deadline (strictly finished). If a result is delayed, huge loss may happen. What is the difference between Hard real time and Soft real time system? Check this article.
6. [CFS: Completely fair process scheduling in Linux](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/fair-scheduling-linux)<br>
  Completely fair scheduling (CFS), is the scheduling class for normal (as opposed to real-time) processes.
7. [Real-Time Linux Kernel Scheduler](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10165)<br>
  Real-time systems require that tasks be executed in a strict priority order. This necessitates that only the N highest-priority tasks be running at any given point in time, where N is the number of CPUs. A variation to this requirement could be strict priority-ordered scheduling in a given subset of CPUs or scheduling domains.
8. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)<br>
  Preemptive scheduling is used when a process switches from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state. Non-preemptive Scheduling is used when a process terminates, or a process switches from running to waiting state.
9. [CPU Scheduling in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)<br>
  A typical process involves both I/O time and CPU time. In a uni programming system like MS-DOS, time spent waiting for I/O is wasted and CPU is free during this time. In multi programming systems, one process can use CPU while another is waiting for I/O. This is possible only with process scheduling. This article explains the difference of some scheduling algorithms.
10. [Understanding CPU and I/O bound](https://www.hellsoft.se/understanding-cpu-and-i-o-bound-for-asynchronous-operations/)<br>
  In this post, the writer try to explain the differences between I/O-bound vs CPU-bound and why it is important to understand them when it comes to client applications.
